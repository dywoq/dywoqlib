## Proposal Writing Guidelines

### 1. Goal
- Clearly state **what you want**.
- Example:  
  > Propose adding a `Pool` utility to handle goroutines efficiently.

**Rule:** Reader should instantly understand the purpose.

---

### 2. Problem
- Describe the **pain point** your feature solves.
- Keep it concrete and brief; avoid unnecessary background.

**Rule:** Show **why the current situation is insufficient**.

---

### 3. Solution
- Introduce your **proposed feature or change**.
- Explain **how it solves the problem**.
- Use short examples if necessary.

**Rule:** Focus on **clarity, not completeness**.

---

### 4. Benefits
- List **concrete advantages** for the user or system.
- Optional: include performance improvements or developer convenience.
- Keep it short — 2–4 bullet points max.

**Rule:** Make it obvious **why it matters**.

---

### 5. Potential Objections
- Note **risks, trade-offs, or alternatives** if relevant.
- Be honest; don’t oversell.

**Rule:** Preemptively address concerns.

---

### 6. Minimalism
- One page is enough; one paragraph per section is often ideal.
- Use **plain language**, short sentences, and direct structure.

**Rule:** Every word should support the core message.

---

### 7. Call-to-Action
- Suggest **next steps**: “Review and merge,” “Feedback requested,” etc.
- Be polite but confident.

---

### 8. Bugs (Optional)
- If the proposal addresses a **bug or issue**, briefly describe it.
- Include:
  - **What the bug is**
  - **When it occurs**
  - **Impact on users or system**
- Show how your proposal **fixes or mitigates** it.

**Rule:** Keep it factual; avoid long narratives or blame. Focus on **resolution**.

### Extra Tips
- Use headers for readability.
- Format code snippets neatly.
- Avoid jargon unless audience is expected to understand.
- Include examples sparingly — only if they clarify.
